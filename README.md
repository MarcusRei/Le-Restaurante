### Notice
This was originally a group assignment at Medieinstitutet. I have since then refactored the whole code base and added some new but basic functionality. If you want to see the original project you can [click here](https://github.com/Medieinstitutet/the-restaurant-grupp-8)
### Project description
This is a basic online booking system for a made up restaurant. It features a basic SPA with the ability to make a reservation for a table. There are some basic validations both on the frontend and backend.

The project also features a admin dashboard where you can update different reservations and get a basic table view of the restaurants and the reservations. To access the admin dashboard you type navigate to "/admin".

### Frontend built with
- React
- Typescript
- React Calendar
- Luxon
- Vite

### Backend built with
- NodeJS
- ExpressJS
- MongooseJS
- MongoDB
